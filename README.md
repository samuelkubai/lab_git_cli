### Lab: Git CLI
This is a small project to replicate git in rust in order to learn the rust language in more depth.
I was following a tutorial by [tensor programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVuq8IkfkiY)

#### What can the CLI do?
The CLI at the moment can `init`, `add` and `commit`, by saving the blobs and objects to the .tgit folder in the project.
